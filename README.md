# Languages Benchmarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Don't cheat, create a real algorithm that solves the requested problem.
> - Use all the resources provided by the language and its std, even concurrency and/or multithreading.
> - FFI is not allowed, use the language itself.
> - Compute the answer by brute force, don't do divide and conquer, but is allowed to split the algorithm by chunks (useful when threading).
> - Don't do public the answer, do first the oficial challenge with your inputs, and then change to the inputs provided by this readme.

> [!NOTE]
> To add another language, create a new folder and branch with the language name. If the name has any symbols like C#, use another name like csharp.

> Structure your subproject to have one executable file per challenge. Example:
> ```
> language/
>   challenge-1/
>     main.lang
>   challenge-2/
>     main.lang
> ```

## Tools used

- Task runner: [task](https://taskfile.dev/)

## [Advent of Code - Year 2015 - Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/4)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The program must accept two positional arguments
> - the first, a string representing the secret key
> - the second, an integer between 5 and 7 representing the number of zeros
>
> Try locally with the inputs provided on the challenge page
>
> Just compute the requested number and print it
